# Following Deep Learning for Computer-Vision with-Python and TensorFlow Tutorial.
Following the video *Deep Learning for Computer Vision with Python and TensorFlow â€“ Complete Course* tutorial on YouTube to learn more about TensorFlow by freeCodeCamp.org (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA3WxTTPXqQ). The code may be very similar to that in the tutorial, and I may add extra comments or refactor some portions of the code for easier reading or better performance.
